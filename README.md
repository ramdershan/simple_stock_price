This project is one of the simple projects from freecodecamp's [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwSS70SZdyM) channel

The app can either be run from a local machine or via the streamlit app link.

###Local Machine

The app can be run locally in a virtual environment (i.e. conda) with the packages in the *requirments.txt* file installed and the following command:

```bash
streamlit run simple_stock_streamlit.py
```

###Streamlit App Link

I have also deployed this app on streamlit's community cloud. The app can accessed through the following link: https://simple-stock-price-ramd.streamlit.app/
